# Hello Folks!!

This is my first python project!!!


## How to run the game.
To run the game on your system execute this commmand on your shell:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Or
```bash
python<your python version> -m pip install pygame
```

If you have pygame installed on your system you can ignore that commmand. To actually run the game just go to the game directory (Try_to_survive). Then run this commmand on your shell:


```bash
python<your python version> Try_to_survive.py
```

Boom you did it!! 

If you face any problems make sure to run this commmand:
```bash
pip install pygame --upgrade
```
Or
```bash
python<your python version> -m pip install pygame --upgrade
```
If you still face problems try to contact with the author of this repo.

## How to play the game.

<b>1</b>. You have to collect 1 flesh to win the game. If you can't find the monster will eat your flesh.

The flesh looks like this:

<b>2</b>. The monster can't chase you if you don't look at him. And if you look at him you are practically dead because the monster will be faster than you. The monster looks like this:

<b>3</b>. There is another monster (ghost) that will help the monster. If you look at the ghost and if it makes a whistle sound then you have to run because the monster knows your location. The ghost looks like this:

<b>4</b>. <b>MOST IMPORTANTLY when the monster is in your vision range there will be an alert sound. If you hear the sound don't look around!</b>

<b>5</b>. Use arrow keys to move around. And enjoy the game!!
