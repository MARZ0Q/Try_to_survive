# Hello Folks!!

This is my first python project!!!


## How to run the game.
To run the game on your system execute this commmand on your shell:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Or
```bash
python<your python version> -m pip install pygame
```

If you have pygame installed on your system you can ignore that commmand. To actually run the game just go to the game directory (Try_to_survive). Then run this commmand on your shell:


```bash
python<your python version> Try_to_survive.py
```

Boom you did it!! 

If you face any problems make sure to run this commmand:
```bash
pip install pygame --upgrade
```
Or
```bash
python<your python version> -m pip install pygame --upgrade
```
If you still face problems try to contact with the author of this repo.
